# Discord Bot That Filters Profanity 
This bot utilizes regex rather than neural-based Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

[Here](https://youtu.be/3u8xdN3v22I) is a bot demo (outdated). 

# Word Lists
Both the default blacklist and whitelist can be found [here](https://github.com/senseibence/discord-profanity-bot/blob/main/Discord%20Profanity%20Bot%20Source/profanityList.js).

Changes made to the lists by individual servers are not reflected here.
